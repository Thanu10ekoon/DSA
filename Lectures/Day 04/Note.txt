*we can make pointer/reference value NULL in c,c++ without a dpubt. But in c# we have to make the variable nullable using
'?' to assign the address as null.
	ex:-	public Node? Next { get; set; }

		public Node(int data) 
		{
    			Data = data;
    			Next = null;
		}

Arrays	-> Done	-> Fixed Size is major issue
Dynamic Arrays	-> Done	-> fixed the size issue but remove and insert is not efficient

*LINKED LIST*

	-have nodes and we connect those nodes by links
	-links is based on reference variables(w/ memory addresses)
	-In our example (LinkedList02):
		~one node have 2 parts, 
			+one containing data of this node
			+another containing address of next node
		~the whole chain/list contains linked nodes constructed in that way
		~additionally we have 'head' & 'tail' to store addresses of 1st and last nodes/elements of our list
