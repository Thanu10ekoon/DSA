***None-Linear Data Structures
	1. Trees
	2. Graphs
  + Linear is data structured one after the other
  + But non-linear one there is no sequential line arrangement but have interconnected more complex structure

**Trees

*Root - Start of tree (First node of tree)
*Leaf - Last node of a Branch
*Edges - similar to graphs, these connect nodes
*Branches - different paths with different nodes + edges
* Hierarchy of one Branch :- Root -> Parent nodes -> Child Nodes
* Height of a tree - Root to Leaf(last node of branch) nodes count / Number of children in a single branch.(Root excluded) 
* Siblings - Nodes with similar hierarchy level in another branch

* Graphs have circles/loops but Trees have ends(ends with a leaf node)

**Binary Search Tree

* Binary means 2 So, these have only TWO CHILDREN nodes
* Any SINGLE NODE can have ONLY 2 or LESS number of CHILDREN
* other search trees are multiway trees
* We use these for searching

* Any BST Root have 2 children
	* Left hand side - if Parent(Root in here) > Child node value -> Left Child
	* Right hand Side - if Parent < Child -> Right Child
