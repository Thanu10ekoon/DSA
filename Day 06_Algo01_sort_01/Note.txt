**Algorithms
	*Sorting
	  -Bubble sort
	  -Insertion sort
	  -Selection sort
	  -Quick sort
	  -Merge sort
	  -Heap sort

Time Complexity
	Best Case = Big Omega
	Worst Case= Big O
	Avg Case  = Big-Theta

Space Complexity??????

Stability
	If two or more items with same value stays in same arrangement even after sorted, it is a stable sorting algorithm
	if they are also swapped unnecessarily, it is unstable

Bubble Sort
	We can optimize this algo by putting a flag variable to stop repetition even after array is done sorting
